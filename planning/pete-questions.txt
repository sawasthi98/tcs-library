questions

- so far, haven't needed to use the api access/secret keys when testing it out on postman
- running into some bad files where they're not downloadable or accessible because either the files display not found or they have limited access bc we're not logged in with the free account

react-pdf for file rendering
use loading spinner between request start and finish
can make from react app because they're unkeyed
fetch from front end
react-pdf viewing library 
app.js, useeffect, make request, .then, put in state, display in state (using pdf-test react app)
 can change css by wrapping in div and control that way 
find 5 known things that work - pride and prejudice, huckleberry finn, 

access/secret key: need keys for non-read operations 



controller method in our own backend that is hardcoded to request huckleberry finn
hit that endpoint from rest client or postman 
test-drive the java code that makes the request
then modify that route to take in parameters so it can make a request for any book
then hook it onto our frontend
